# AMPLink
## (Advanced Moderation Panel Linker)
 AMPLink is a powerful tool that allows Administrators easy access to their Space Engineers servers through an easy to use webpanel.
 
 AMPLink relies on a RestAPI plugin for Torch called "TorchRemote."

 # ROADMAP:
 - Torch Installation / Uninstallation of Plugins [WORKING]
 - Torch Instance Configuration [WORKING]
 
 - Server Grid List [PLANNED] (when zznty adds it)
 - Server Mods Management [PLANNED] (when zznty adds it)
 - Server Scheduled Actions (AutoRestart, etc) [PLANNED]


<b>AMPLink is currently in ALPHA, and many features are either planned, don't work, or are unstable! I highly discourage using this in production use at the current moment.</b>
