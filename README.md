# AMPLink
## (Advanced Moderation Panel Linker)
 AMPLink is a powerful tool that allows Administrators easy access to their Space Engineers servers through an easy to use webpanel.
 
 AMPLink relies on a RestAPI plugin for Torch called "TorchRemote."

 ## ROADMAP:
 - Torch Installation / Uninstallation of Plugins [WORKING]
 - Torch Instance Configuration [WORKING]
 
 - Server Grid List [PLANNED]
 - Server Mods Management [PLANNED] (when zznty adds it)
 - Server Scheduled Actions (AutoRestart, etc) [PLANNED]
 - Redo UI [PLANNED]
 - Workshop Browser [PLANNED]
 - Add more ranks for Users management. (ex: Normal User, Admin User, Superuser)

 ## Features and planned features:
Here is a long list of what I plan to add to or already added to AMPLink.<br>

Users System:<br>
One unique thing about AMPLink is that you can give your users certain features. For instance, User A is registered as a Normal User, and can only:
 - restart the server
 - stop the server
 - start the server
 - view console
As well as:
 - Promote/Demote users in game
 - Kick/Ban users in game.

But on the other hand, User B, which is a superuser can:

 - Do everything a Normal User can with the addition of:
 - Add/Remove other users in AMPLink
 - Add/Remove mods from the Steam Workshop
 - Configure the Torch Instance and World Settings
 - Add/Remove Plugins from Torch as well as uploading your own plugin
 - Allow for the configuration of said plugins as well.
 
Clearly everything isnt added at the moment, but this is what I plan to add.<br>

<b>AMPLink is currently in ALPHA, and many features are either planned, don't work, or are unstable! I highly discourage using this in production use at the current moment.</b>
